Overview\n","*   **Objective:** To develop a regression model predicting a continuous grammar score (observed range: 1.0 to 5.0 based on the 'label' column) for spoken English audio samples (45-60 seconds). The model takes an audio file as input and outputs the predicted score.\n","*   **Dataset:** Provided training set (444 samples with scores) and test set (195 samples for prediction, 204 in `test.csv`). Audio files in `.wav` format. *(Note: test.csv has 204 rows, ensure submission aligns if needed, though standard SHL usually uses the 195)*.\n","*   **Evaluation Metric:** Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) for internal model evaluation. The final reported score requires the **Training RMSE**. The competition leaderboard uses a separate metric where higher scores are better.\n","\n","## 2. Data Loading and Exploration\n","*   **Data Source:** Loaded `train.csv` and `test.csv` from the Kaggle `/kaggle/input/shl-intern-hiring-assessment/Dataset/` directory. Audio files located in corresponding `audios/train/` and `audios/test/` subdirectories.\n","*   **Score Column:** The target variable containing grammar scores was confirmed as the column named `label` in `train.csv`.\n","*   **Score Distribution:** The scores in the training data range from 1.0 to 5.0, with a mean of approximately 3.97 and a standard deviation of 1.05. The distribution appears somewhat skewed towards the higher scores (4.0 and 5.0). *(Refine description based on the histogram visualization if desired)*.\n","*   **Audio Properties:** Checked sample audio files. Confirmed durations were approximately 60 seconds. Confirmed sample rates were 16000 Hz and audio was mono, matching the `TARGET_SR` and preprocessing expectations.\n","\n","## 3. Preprocessing\n","*   **Audio Handling:** All audio files were loaded using `librosa` with the `sr=TARGET_SR` (16000 Hz) and `mono=True` parameters, ensuring uniform sample rate and single-channel audio. Audio data was converted to `float32` NumPy arrays.\n","*   **Speech-to-Text (ASR):** OpenAI's Whisper ASR model (size: `small`) was used to transcribe the audio content into text. This model was chosen for a better balance between accuracy and computational cost compared to `base`.\n","*   **Caching:** Generated transcriptions were cached to CSV files (`train_transcriptions_small.csv`, `test_transcriptions_small.csv`) in `/kaggle/working/transcriptions/` to significantly speed up subsequent notebook runs.\n","*   **Error Handling:** Files not found or encountering transcription errors resulted in an empty string transcription to prevent downstream issues.\n","\n","## 4. Feature Engineering\n","*   **Method:** Sentence embeddings were generated using the `sentence-transformers` library to capture semantic meaning and context from the transcriptions, replacing the initial TF-IDF approach.\n","*   **Model:** The pre-trained `'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'` model was used due to its good balance of performance and speed.\n","*   **Process:** Each transcription (from both train and test sets) was passed through the SentenceTransformer model to produce a fixed-size dense vector embedding (384 dimensions for this model).\n","*   **Result:** This resulted in dense NumPy arrays `X_train_features` (444, 384) and `X_test_features` (204, 384) used as input for the regression model.\n","\n","## 5. Methodology / Model Architecture\n","*   **Model Choice:** An XGBoost Regressor (`xgboost.XGBRegressor`) was selected for modeling.\n","*   **Rationale:** XGBoost is well-suited for structured data, including dense embeddings, and offers robust performance with built-in regularization and handling of potential non-linear relationships between features and the target score.\n","*   **Hyperparameters:** Key hyperparameters included `n_estimators=300` (max), `learning_rate=0.03`, `max_depth=4`, `subsample=0.7`, `colsample_bytree=0.7`, `gamma=0.2`, `reg_alpha=0.01`. *(Note: These might benefit from further tuning via cross-validation)*.\n","*   **Training Strategy:** Early stopping (`early_stopping_rounds=30`) was employed during initial training on a validation split to prevent overfitting and determine a reasonable number of boosting rounds (identified as 322 rounds in the final run).\n","\n","## 6. Training\n","*   **Data Split:** The training embedding features (`X_train_features`) and corresponding labels (`y_train`) were split into an 80% training set and a 20% validation set (`random_state=42`).\n","*   **Initial Training:** The XGBoost model was first trained on the 80% training split, using the 20% validation split to monitor RMSE and trigger early stopping.\n","*   **Final Training:** The final XGBoost model was retrained on the **entire** training dataset (all 444 samples and their embedding features) using the hyperparameters from the initial model and the optimal number of estimators (322 rounds) determined by early stopping.\n","\n","## 7. Evaluation\n","*   **Validation Performance:** The model trained on the 80% split achieved the following performance on the 20% validation set:\n","    *   Validation RMSE: **1.0304**\n","    *   Validation MAE: **0.8348**\n","    *   The validation scatter plot shows the relationship between true and predicted scores on this held-out set. *(Briefly comment on the plot, e.g., \"While showing a positive correlation, the plot indicates considerable scatter, suggesting the model struggled somewhat to generalize perfectly on this specific validation split based on RMSE.\")*\n","*   **REQUIRED Training Performance:** The final model, retrained on the entire training dataset, achieved the following performance *on that same training dataset*:\n","    *   **Training RMSE: 0.1447** *(This is the mandatory value for submission)*\n","    *   This very low training RMSE indicates the model with sentence embeddings fits the training data extremely well.\n","\n","## 8. Prediction Pipeline for Test Set\n","*   The pipeline applied to the test data was:\n","    1.  Load audio, resample to 16kHz, convert to mono.\n","    2.  Transcribe using Whisper `small`.\n","    3.  Generate sentence embeddings using `'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'`.\n","    4.  Predict scores using the final XGBoost model trained on all training data embeddings.\n","    5.  Clip predictions to the observed training score range [1.00, 5.00].\n","    6.  Save results to `submission.csv` with 'filename' and 'label' columns.\n","\n","## 9. Conclusion & Discussion\n","*   **Summary:** This notebook implements an end-to-end pipeline using Whisper `small` for ASR, Sentence-BERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for feature extraction, and XGBoost for regression. The model achieved a very strong fit on the training data (Training RMSE: **0.1447**). The performance on the hidden test set yielded a leaderboard score of 0.459 (on the competition's specific metric).\n","*   **Observations:** The switch from TF-IDF to Sentence-BERT significantly improved the model's ability to fit the training data (very low training RMSE), although the validation RMSE (1.0304) was higher than desired, suggesting potential sensitivity to the specific train/validation split or room for hyperparameter optimization. The final test score (0.459) indicates good performance but leaves a gap compared to the top leaderboard score (0.96), suggesting the evaluation metric might strongly favor features more directly related to grammatical correctness than semantic embeddings alone.\n","*   **Limitations:**\n","    *   ASR errors still possible even with Whisper `small`.\n","    *   Sentence embeddings capture semantics well but might not be optimal for purely grammatical error detection as per the rubric.\n","    *   Single train/validation split might not be fully representative; cross-validation would be more robust.\n","    *   XGBoost hyperparameters were adjusted slightly but not systematically tuned.\n","*   **Potential Future Improvements:**\n","    *   **Linguistic Features:** Implement feature extraction using `spaCy` (POS tags, dependency relations, sentence structure stats) to directly target grammatical aspects, either replacing or combining with SBERT embeddings.\n","    *   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Use `RandomizedSearchCV` or `GridSearchCV` with K-Fold Cross-Validation to optimize XGBoost (or other models like LightGBM) for the chosen feature set (embeddings, linguistic, or combined).\n","    *   **Advanced Embeddings/Models:** Explore larger Sentence-BERT models or even fine-tuning language models if compute resources allow.\n","    *   **Ensembling:** Combine predictions from models trained on different feature sets (e.g., SBERT vs Linguistic) or different algorithms."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"gpu","dataSources":[{"databundleVersionId":11872932,"sourceId":97919,"sourceType":"competition"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31011,"isGpuEnabled":true,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.11"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
